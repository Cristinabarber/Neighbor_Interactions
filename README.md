## Spatial models for plant neighborhood dynamics in Stan
<small> In this case study, we demonstrate how Stanâ€™s segment function can speed computation on sparse matrices of pairwise neighbors in plant-plant interaction models. In addition, we present solutions to common problems of fitting neighborhood models with hierarchical effects, including a comparison of centered vs. non-centered parameterizations.</small>
