	abstract = {1. We investigated the relationships of seed size, dispersal mode and other species characteristics to interspecific variation in mean primary seed dispersal distances, mean annual seed production per unit basal area, and clumping of seed deposition among 41 tropical tree species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. 2. A hierarchical Bayesian model incorporating interannual variation in seed production was used to estimate seed dispersal, seed production, and clumping of seed rain for each species from 19 years of data for 188 seed traps on a 50-ha plot in which all adult trees were censused every 5 years. 3. Seed dispersal was modelled as a two-dimensional Student's T distribution with the degrees of freedom parameter fixed at 3, interannual variation in seed production per basal area was modelled as a lognormal, and the clumping of seed rain around its expected value was modelled as a negative binomial distribution. 4. There was wide variation in seed dispersal distances among species sharing the same mode of seed dispersal. Seed dispersal mode did not explain significant variation in seed dispersal distances, but did explain significant variation in clumping: animal-dispersed species showed higher clumping of seed deposition. 5. Among nine wind-dispersed species, the combination of diaspore terminal velocity, tree height and wind speed in the season of peak dispersal explained 40\% of variation in dispersal distances. Among 31 animal-dispersed species, 20\% of interspecific variation in dispersal distances was explained by seed mass (a negative effect) and tree height (a positive effect). 6. Among all species, seed mass, tree height and dispersal syndrome explained 28\% of the variation in mean dispersal distance and seed mass alone explained 45\% of the variation in estimated seed production per basal area. 7. Synthesis. There is wide variation in patterns of primary seed rain among tropical tree species. Substantial proportions of interspecific variation in seed production, seed dispersal distances, and clumping of seed deposition are explained by relatively easily measured plant traits, especially dispersal mode, seed mass, and tree height. This provides hope for trait-based generalization and modelling of seed dispersal in tropical forests.},

	abstract = {Mapping species through classification of imaging spectroscopy data is facilitating research to understand tree species distributions at increasingly greater spatial scales. Classification requires a dataset of field observations matched to the image, which will often reflect natural species distributions, resulting in an imbalanced dataset with many samples for common species and few samples for less common species. Despite the high prevalence of imbalanced datasets in multiclass species predictions, the effect on species prediction accuracy and landscape species abundance has not yet been quantified. First, we trained and assessed the accuracy of a support vector machine ({SVM}) model with a highly imbalanced dataset of 20 tropical species and one mixed-species class of 24 species identified in a hyperspectral image mosaic (350–2500 nm) of Panamanian farmland and secondary forest fragments. The model, with an overall accuracy of 62\% ± 2.3\% and F-score of 59\% ± 2.7\%, was applied to the full image mosaic (23,000 ha at a 2-m resolution) to produce a species prediction map, which suggested that this tropical agricultural landscape is more diverse than what has been presented in field-based studies. Second, we quantified the effect of class imbalance on model accuracy. Model assessment showed a trend where species with more samples were consistently over predicted while species with fewer samples were under predicted. Standardizing sample size reduced model accuracy, but also reduced the level of species over- and under-prediction. This study advances operational species mapping of diverse tropical landscapes by detailing the effect of imbalanced data on classification accuracy and providing estimates of tree species abundance in an agricultural landscape. Species maps using data and methods presented here can be used in landscape analyses of species distributions to understand human or environmental effects, in addition to focusing conservation efforts in areas with high tree cover and diversity.},

We perturbed an empirical sagebrush steppe community model to remove the demographic effect of niche differences and quantify their impact on coexistence. With stabilizing mechanisms operating, all species showed positive growth rates when rare, generating stable coexistence. Fluctuation-independent mechanisms contributed more than temporal variability to coexistence and operated more strongly on recruitment than growth or survival. As expected, removal of stabilizing niche differences led to extinction of all inferior competitors. However, complete exclusion required 300–400 years, indicating small ﬁtness differences among species. Our results show an Ô{excessÕ} of niche differences: stabilizing mechanisms were not only strong enough to maintain diversity but were much stronger than necessary given the small ﬁtness differences. The diversity of this community cannot be understood without consideration of niche differences.},

	abstract = {Advances in computing power in the past 20 years have led to a proliferation of spatially explicit, individual-based models of population and ecosystem dynamics. In forest ecosystems, the individual-based models encapsulate an emerging theory of “neighborhood” dynamics, in which fine-scale spatial interactions regulate the demography of component tree species. The spatial distribution of component species, in turn, regulates spatial variation in a whole host of community and ecosystem properties, with subsequent feedbacks on component species. The development of these models has been facilitated by development of new methods of analysis of field data, in which critical demographic rates and ecosystem processes are analyzed in terms of the spatial distributions of neighboring trees and physical environmental factors. The analyses are based on likelihood methods and information theory, and they allow a tight linkage between the models and explicit parameterization of the models from field data. Maximum likelihood methods have a long history of use for point and interval estimation in statistics. In contrast, likelihood principles have only more gradually emerged in ecology as the foundation for an alternative to traditional hypothesis testing. The alternative framework stresses the process of identifying and selecting among competing models, or in the simplest case, among competing point estimates of a parameter of a model. There are four general steps involved in a likelihood analysis: (1) model specification, (2) parameter estimation using maximum likelihood methods, (3) model comparison, and (4) model evaluation. Our goal in this paper is to review recent developments in the use of likelihood methods and modeling for the analysis of neighborhood processes in forest ecosystems. We will focus on a single class of processes, seed dispersal and seedling dispersion, because recent papers provide compelling evidence of the potential power of the approach, and illustrate some of the statistical challenges in applying the methods.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing data provides unique information about the Earth’s surface that can be used to address ecological questions. Linking high-resolution remote sensing data to field-based ecological data requires methods to identify objects of interest directly on georeferenced remote sensing digital images while in the field. Mapping individual trees with a {GPS} often has location error and is focused on the position of the tree stem rather than the crown, often creating a mismatch between field data and the pixel information. We describe a mapping process that uses a consumer-grade {GPS} and tablet computer to spatially match individual trees measured in the field directly to a digital image of their crowns taken from above the canopy. This paper outlines the reasons for using digital field mapping and a summary of the equipment and process, with supplemental material providing a detailed field protocol. As more remote sensing data with a resolution capable of resolving individual trees become available, the opportunities to leverage these data for ecological studies grow. We provide guidelines for those wanting to apply imagery to expand the spatial scale and extent of ecological studies.},

	abstract = {Long-distance seed dispersal ({LDD}) is considered a crucial determinant of tree distributions, but its effects depend on demographic processes that enable seeds to establish into adults and that remain poorly understood at large spatial scales. We estimated rates of seed arrival, germination, and survival and growth for a canopy tree species (Miliusa horsfieldii), in a landscape ranging from evergreen forest, where the species' abundance is high, to deciduous forest, where it is extremely low. We then used an individual-based model ({IBM}) to predict sapling establishment and to compare the relative importance of seed arrival and establishment in explaining the observed distribution of seedlings. Individuals in deciduous forest, far from the source population, experienced multiple benefits (e.g., increased germination rate and seedling survival and growth) from being in a habitat where conspecifics were almost absent. The net effect of these spatial differences in demographic processes was significantly higher estimated sapling establishment probabilities for seeds dispersed long distances into deciduous forest. Despite the high rate of establishment in this habitat, Miliusa is rare in the deciduous forest because the arrival of seeds at long distances from the source population is extremely low. Across the entire landscape, the spatial pattern of seed arrival is much more important than the spatial pattern of establishment for explaining observed seedling distributions. By using dynamic models to link demographic data to spatial patterns, we show that {LDD} plays a pivotal role in the distribution of this tree in its native habitat.},

Theory predicts that interactions with neighbors of the same (conspecific) and other (heterospecific) species can influence a species’ relative abundance, but empirical tests are lacking. By using a hierarchical model of survival for more than 30,000 seedlings of 180 tropical tree species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, we tested whether species’ sensitivity to neighboring individuals relates to their relative abundance in the community. We found wide variation among species in the effect of conspecific, but not heterospecific, neighbors on survival, and we found a significant relationship between the strength of conspecific neighbor effects and species abundance. Specifically, rare species suffered more from the presence of conspecific neighbors than common species did, suggesting that conspecific density dependence shapes species abundances in diverse communities.
Seedling survival in a tropical forest shows that species abundance is related to a species’ sensitivity to conspecific neighbors.

	abstract = {Bayesian population models can be exceedingly slow due, in part, to the choice to simulate discrete latent states. Here, we discuss an alternative approach to discrete latent states, marginalization, that forms the basis of maximum likelihood population models and is much faster. Our manuscript has two goals: 1) to introduce readers unfamiliar with marginalization to the concept and provide worked examples, and 2) to address topics associated with marginalization that have not been previously synthesized and are relevant to both Bayesian and maximum likelihood models. We begin by explaining marginalization using a Cormack-Jolly-Seber model. Next, we apply marginalization to multistate capture-recapture, community occupancy, and integrated population models and briefly discuss random effects, priors, and pseudo-R2. Then, we focus on recovery of discrete latent states, defining different types of conditional probabilities and showing how quantities such as population abundance or species richness can be estimated in marginalized code. Lastly, we show that occupancy and site-abundance models with auto-covariates can be fit with marginalized code with minimal impact on parameter estimates. Marginalized code was anywhere from five to {\textgreater}1000 times faster than discrete code and differences in inferences were minimal. Discrete latent states and fully conditional approaches provide the best estimates of conditional probabilities for a given site or individual. However, estimates for parameters and derived quantities such as species richness and abundance are minimally affected by marginalization. In the case of abundance, marginalized code is both quicker and has lower bias than an N-augmentation approach. Understanding how marginalization works shrinks the divide between Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches to population models. Some models that have only been presented in a Bayesian framework can easily be fit in maximum likelihood. On the other hand, factors such as informative priors, random effects, or pseudo-R2 values may motivate a Bayesian approach in some applications. An understanding of marginalization allows users to minimize the speed that is sacrificed when switching from a maximum likelihood approach. Widespread application of marginalization in Bayesian population models will facilitate more thorough simulation studies, comparisons of alternative model structures, and faster learning.},

	abstract = {Bayesian inference is a powerful tool to better understand ecological processes across varied subfields in ecology, and is often implemented in generic and flexible software packages such as the widely used {BUGS} family ({BUGS}, {WinBUGS}, {OpenBUGS} and {JAGS}). However, some models have prohibitively long run times when implemented in {BUGS}. A relatively new software platform called Stan uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo ({HMC}), a family of Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) algorithms which promise improved efficiency and faster inference relative to those used by {BUGS}. Stan is gaining traction in many fields as an alternative to {BUGS}, but adoption has been slow in ecology, likely due in part to the complex nature of {HMC}. Here, we provide an intuitive illustration of the principles of {HMC} on a set of simple models. We then compared the relative efficiency of {BUGS} and Stan using population ecology models that vary in size and complexity. For hierarchical models, we also investigated the effect of an alternative parameterization of random effects, known as non-centering. For small, simple models there is little practical difference between the two platforms, but Stan outperforms {BUGS} as model size and complexity grows. Stan also performs well for hierarchical models, but is more sensitive to model parameterization than {BUGS}. Stan may also be more robust to biased inference caused by pathologies, because it produces diagnostic warnings where {BUGS} provides none. Disadvantages of Stan include an inability to use discrete parameters, more complex diagnostics and a greater requirement for hands-on tuning. Given these results, Stan is a valuable tool for many ecologists utilizing Bayesian inference, particularly for problems where {BUGS} is prohibitively slow. As such, Stan can extend the boundaries of feasible models for applied problems, leading to better understanding of ecological processes. Fields that would likely benefit include estimation of individual and population growth rates, meta-analyses and cross-system comparisons and spatiotemporal models.},

At the broader scale, national datasets exist for a large number of geospatial features of land, water, and air that are needed to fully understand variation among these ecosystems. However, such datasets originate from different sources and have different spatial and temporal resolutions. By taking an open-science perspective and by combining site-based ecosystem datasets and national geospatial datasets, science gains the ability to ask important research questions related to grand environmental challenges that operate at broad scales. Documentation of such complicated database integration efforts, through peer-reviewed papers, is recommended to foster reproducibility and future use of the integrated database. Here, we describe the major steps, challenges, and considerations in building an integrated database of lake ecosystems, called {LAGOS} ({LAke} multi-scaled {GeOSpatial} and temporal database), that was developed at the sub-continental study extent of 17 {US} states (1,800,000 km2). {LAGOS} includes two modules: {LAGOSGEO}, with geospatial data on every lake with surface area larger than 4 ha in the study extent ({\textasciitilde}50,000 lakes), including climate, atmospheric deposition, land use/cover, hydrology, geology, and topography measured across a range of spatial and temporal extents; and {LAGOSLIMNO}, with lake water quality data compiled from {\textasciitilde}100 individual datasets for a subset of lakes in the study extent ({\textasciitilde}10,000 lakes). Procedures for the integration of datasets included: creating a flexible database design; authoring and integrating metadata; documenting data provenance; quantifying spatial measures of geographic data; quality-controlling integrated and derived data; and extensively documenting the database. Our procedures make a large, complex, and integrated database reproducible and extensible, allowing users to ask new research questions with the existing database or through the addition of new data. The largest challenge of this task was the heterogeneity of the data, formats, and metadata. Many steps of data integration need manual input from experts in diverse fields, requiring close collaboration.},

	abstract = {The Gibbs sampler, the algorithm of Metropolis and similar iterative simulation methods are potentially very helpful for summarizing multivariate distributions. Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

We present a method for calibrating spatial models of plant recruitment that does not require identifying the specific parent of each recruit. This method calibrates seedling recruitment functions by comparing tree seedling distributions with adult distributions via a maximum likelihood analysis. The models obtained from this method can then be used to predict the spatial distributions of seedlings from adult distributions. We calibrated recruitment functions for 10 tree species characteristic of transition oaknorthern hardwood forests. Significant differences were found in recruit abundances and spatial distributions. Predicted seedling recruitment limitation for test stands varied substantially between species, with little recruitment limitation for some species and strong recruitment limitation for others. Recruitment was limited due to low overall recruit production or to restricted recruit dispersion. When these seedling recruitment parameters were incorporated into a spatial, individual-based model of forest dynamics, called {SORTIE}, alterations of recruitment parameters produced substantial changes in species abundance, providing additional support for the potential importance of seedling recruitment processes in community structure and dynamics.},

	abstract = {1 We quantified neighbourhood effects on sapling growth for 60 tree species in the 50-ha plot in Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Additionally, we tested whether target sapling growth responds to taxonomic or functional identity of neighbouring species by comparing four alternate models (that all neighbours have equivalent effects on the target; that conspecific and heterospecific neighbours have distinct effects; that heterospecific neighbours can be divided into confamilials and non-confamilials; and that they can be divided according to their response to light availability). 2 Over half of the species (34 out of 60) analysed were consistent with all neighbours having equivalent effects on the target. This may result from diffuse evolution allowing tolerance of a large number of neighbouring species or could be a statistical artefact of over-clumping species into large neighbour groups (e.g. heterospecific neighbours). 3 Other species supported models that differentiated between conspecific and heterospecific (n = 6) or between confamilial vs. non-confamilial (n = 5) neighbours and, in general, effects of neighbours were stronger if they were more closely related to the target. Where target species differentiated between neighbours from different light guilds (n = 15), effects were stronger if both belonged to the same guild (i.e. both gap requiring or both shade tolerant). 4 Despite the fact that the majority of species did not respond to the identity of neighbours, all differed in their response to the degree of crowding. Our results suggest that the response of target species to crowding, rather than individual species effects on targets, may be subject to selection. 5 Variation among species in response to crowding or to the identity of neighbouring species is likely to contribute to the maintenance of species diversity in tropical forests.},

Although survivorship was density-independent for both species, individual fecundities were affected by the local population density of velvet leaf and pigweed near each plant. We estimated the functional forms of the spatially local density dependence and the distances over which plants interfere with one another. For both species hyperbolic functions provided better fits than either linear or log-linear functions. The apparent significance of higher-order interaction terms from the linear and log-linear regressions appears to be an artifact of the hyperbolic form of the data. We explain aspects of the functional forms of the relations between fecundity and local densities in terms of morphological attributes of each species. We also describe some statistical problems associated with estimating the effects of spatially local inter-individual interference.},

	abstract = {Ant–plant protection symbioses, in which plants provide food and/or shelter for ants in exchange for protection from herbivory, are model systems for understanding the ecology of mutualism. While interactions between ants, host plants, and herbivores have been intensively studied, we know little about how plant–plant interactions influence the dynamics of these mutualisms, despite strong evidence that plants compete for resources, that hosting ants can be costly, and that host-plant provisioning to ants can therefore be constrained by resource availability. We used field experiments in a semiarid Kenyan savanna to examine interactions between the ant-plant Acacia drepanolobium, neighboring grasses, and two species of symbiotic acacia-ants with divergent behaviors: Crematogaster mimosae, an aggressive symbiont that imposes high costs to host trees via consumption of extrafloral nectar, and Tetraponera penzigi, a less-protective symbiont that imposes lower costs because it does not consume nectar. We hypothesized that by competing with acacias for resources, neighboring grasses (1) reduce hosts’ ability to support costly C. mimosae, while having little or no effect on the ability of hosts to support low-cost T. penzigi, and (2) reduce sapling growth rates irrespective of ant occupant. We factorially manipulated the presence/absence of grasses and the identity of ant occupants on saplings and evaluated effects on colony survivorship and sapling growth rates over 40 weeks. Contrary to prediction, the high-cost/high-reward nectar-dependent mutualist C. mimosae had higher colony-survival rates on saplings with grass neighbors present. Grasses appear to have indirectly facilitated the survival of C. mimosae by reducing water stress on host plants; soils under saplings shaded by grasses had higher moisture content, and these saplings produced more active nectaries than grass-removal saplings. Consistent with prediction, survival of low-cost/low-reward T. penzigi did not differ significantly between grass-removal treatments. Saplings occupied by low-cost/low-reward T. penzigi grew 100\% more on average than saplings occupied by high-cost/high-reward C. mimosae, demonstrating that mutualist-partner identity strongly and differentially influences demographic rates of young plants. In contrast, contrary to prediction, grass neighbors had no significant net impact on sapling growth rates. Our results suggest that neighboring plants can exert strong and counterintuitive effects on ant–plant protection symbioses, highlighting the need to integrate plant–plant interactions into our understanding of these mutualisms.},

These models are constructed from submodels, termed predictors, of individual plants. Fecundity and survivorship predictors give the fecundity and survivorship of an individual as a function of local population density. Dispersal predictors predict the dispersal pattern of a plant's maternal progeny and the survivorship of plants from seed to seedlings. We develop both computer models and analytically tractable models. Our computer models are designed to determine the population dynamic consequences of specific fecundity, survivorship and dispersal predictors. The analytical models are valid when dispersal is sufficiently large, and are used to explain the predictions of analogous computer models. We show through examples that the predictions of corresponding computer and analytical models may be virtually identical. Empirical tests of these models are practical because all model parameters and functional forms can be estimated with data obtained in a single year. We describe the experiments and statistical methods used to test a neighborhood model. Finally, we describe how neighborhood models can be used to address specific issues in plant ecology and discuss possible extensions of neighborhood theory.},

We investigated these questions in the shrub Artemisia tridentata and hypothesized that the ability to access and utilize surface water varies among subspecies and cytotypes. We used an isotope tracer to quantify below-ground zone of influence in A. tridentata, and tested whether spatial neighbourhood characteristics can alter plant water uptake. We introduced deuterium-enriched water to the soil in plant interspaces in a common garden experiment and measured deuterium composition of plant stems. We then applied spatially explicit models to test for differential water uptake by A. tridentata, including intermingled populations of three subspecies and two ploidy levels. The results suggest that lateral root functioning in A. tridentata is associated with intraspecific identity and ploidy level. Subspecies adapted to habitats with deep soils generally had a smaller horizontal reach, and polyploid cytotypes were associated with greater water uptake compared to their diploid variants. We also found that plant crown volume was a weak predictor of water uptake, and that neighbourhood crowding had no discernable effect on water uptake. Intraspecific variation in lateral root functioning can lead to differential patterns of resource acquisition, an essential process in arid ecosystems in the contexts of changing climate and seasonal patterns of precipitation. Altogether, we found that lateral root development and activity are more strongly related to genetic variability within A. tridentata than to plant size. Our study highlights how intraspecific variation in life strategies is linked to mechanisms of resource acquisition.

We utilized the Sardinilla experiment in Panamá, the oldest tropical tree diversity experiment, to test how species mixtures at the plot and neighbourhood scales and abiotic environmental characteristics affected 7 coarse root traits of 5 tropical tree species. Sardinilla was planted in 2001 with a gradient of native tree species richness of two-, three- and five-species mixtures and their respective monocultures. Root systems of 128 mature trees were excavated 0.5 m radially and one coarse root was fully excavated; unexcavated root lengths were predicted using species-specific allometric relationships. Root traits included the observed traits primary root length, diameter, and number, the number of secondary roots per meter of primary root, predicted root system extent and total predicted length of roots, and coarse root biomass. Tree size scaled positively with most root traits. Species identity (conspecific or heterospecific) and size of near neighbours were found to explain more variation (63.0\%) in root traits than abiotic environmental characteristics (30.4\%). Trees in waterlogged plots grew fewer, longer roots. Trees reduced root system extent but grew more roots when growing with conspecifics or growing in plots of high soil nitrogen and greater depth to water table. These findings suggest strategies employed by tropical tree species to both reduce competition with neighbours and make the most of local abiotic conditions, bringing us closer to understanding the role of coarse roots in the context of {BEF} research in forests.},

There were 1628, 1478 and 1954 trees in the plots, representing 168, 166 and 171 species respectively. We determined the species of each nearest-neighbor pair of trees, and asked whether the occurrence of species pairs conforms to a simple random mixing model. If trees are randomly mixed in terms of species, the expected frequency of any nearest neighbor species combination is a function of the relative abundance of the two species. Departures from random mixing could arise from species interactions, differential responses to habitat, or both. The number of possible ij species combinations increases approximately as the square of the number of species. For the 168 species in plot 1, for example, there are 14 196 possible combinations. We compared the expected frequency of each species combination in the three plots (42 736 combinations in all) with observed frequencies. Over 98\% of the combinations had observed frequencies of zero and expected frequencies close to zero. A consequence of high diversity is low density of most individual species, and exceedingly low frequencies of the vast majority of species combinations. For each of the 805 combinations with observed frequencies {\textgreater}0, we used simulation to generate a distribution of expected frequencies. We used a t-test to compare the observed frequency with the mean of the simulated distribution for each combination. Only 40 combinations (0.09\% of the possible species combinations in the plots) departed from expected frequencies; 39 combinations were more common, and one less common than expected. The overwhelming majority of nearest neighbor species combinations occur at frequencies predictable from their individual abundances.},

This study evaluated k-nearest neighbor imputation models incorporating {LiDAR} data to predict tree-level inventory data (individual tree height, diameter at breast height, and species) across a 12 100 ha study area in northeastern Oregon, {USA}. The primary objective was to provide spatially explicit data to parameterize the Forest Vegetation Simulator, a tree-level forest growth model. The final imputation model utilized {LiDAR}-derived height measurements and topographic variables to spatially predict tree-level forest inventory data. When compared with an independent data set, the accuracy of forest inventory metrics was high; the root mean square difference of imputed basal area and stem volume estimates were 5 m2Áha–1 and 16 m3Áha–1, respectively. However, the error of imputed forest inventory metrics incorporating small trees (e.g., quadratic mean diameter, tree density) was considerably higher. Forest Vegetation Simulator growth projections based upon imputed forest inventory data follow trends similar to growth projections based upon independent inventory data. This study represents a significant improvement in our capabilities to predict detailed, tree-level forest inventory data across large areas, which could ultimately lead to more informed forest management practices and policies.},

However, these matrices grow quadratically with the number of points. Thus for large point sets it is common to use a low-rank approximation to the distance matrix, which ﬁts in memory and can be efﬁciently analyzed using methods such as multidimensional scaling ({MDS}). In this paper we present a novel sparse method for efﬁciently representing geodesic distance matrices using biharmonic interpolation. This method exploits knowledge of the data manifold to learn a sparse interpolation operator that approximates distances using a subset of points. We show that our method is 2x faster and uses 20x less memory than current leading methods for solving {MDS} on large point sets, with similar quality. This enables analyses of large point sets that were previously infeasible.},

The approach is particularly adapted for setups leading to small spectral widths of the involved matrices and outperforms alternative methods in this regime. By coupling {CHESS} to the {DFT} code {BIGDFT}, we show that such a favorable setup is indeed possible in practice.

Despite a generally positive trajectory in research surrounding model development and assessment, far too little attention has been given to prior specification. Default priors, a sub-class of non-informative prior distributions that are often chosen without critical thought or evaluation, are commonly used in practice. We believe the fear of being too “subjective” has prevented many researchers from using any prior information in their analyses despite the fact that defending prior choice (informative or not) promotes good statistical practice. In this commentary, we provide an overview of how {BDA} is currently being used in a random sample of articles, discuss implications for inference if current bad practices continue, and highlight sub-fields where knowledge about the system has improved inference and promoted good statistical practices through the careful and justified use of informative priors. We hope to inspire a renewed discussion about the use of Bayesian priors in Ecology with particular attention paid to specification and justification. We also emphasize that all priors are the result of a subjective choice, and should be discussed in that way.},

	abstract = {I used a one-dimensional hierarchical design to determine the effect of local versus long-distance neighbors on the growth and reproduction of the annual weed, Cardamine pensylvanica. I measured the response of target plants to the presence or absence of neighbors at the first- and second-nearest neighbor positions and to the overall spatial pattern (clumped, even, or random) of neighbors. In addition, I investigated how variation in interplant spacing and nutrient levels combined with neighbor effects to influence the growth and reproduction of C. pensylvanica. How plants were affected by their neighbors depended upon nutrient levels, plant spacing, and the number of first- and second-position neighbors. Under low nutrient conditions and the closest spacing (0.5 cm), plant growth was so restricted that individual neighbor effects were overshadowed by the overall density effect. At the intermediate spacing (1.0 cm), both the first and the second neighbors influenced fruit number, but at the farthest spacing (1.5 cm) only the first neighbor was significant. Under high nutrient conditions, at all three spacings, first neighbors significantly affected biomass and fruit number, but there were differences among the spacing treatments in how target plants were affected by neighbors. Furthermore, under high nutrients there was a significant global pattern × first neighbor interaction. C. pensylvanica grown in the clumped global pattern with no neighbors at the first position produced significantly more fruit than did plants under any of the other global × neighbor combinations. Although long-distance interactions were only important under special circumstances, their effect was dramatic (an almost two-fold increase in fruit production). This study represents the first experimental test of the assumptions underlying the use of cellular automata models to model plant population dynamics. The results support the basic assumption of cellular automata models, i.e., that nearest neighbor interactions explain most of the variation in growth of plants. However, they also show that under certain conditions long-distance interactions also can have a great influence on the local neighbor effects. Before cellular automata models are extensively applied to model plant populations, further empirical work is needed to determine how competitive relationships among plants change with environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {We examined two ways in which species effects on nitrogen supply rates could inﬂuence species competitive interactions and lead to coexistence between species with very different patterns of resource use. First, through differential effects on the rates of resource cycling, species may modify resources in divergent directions to better tolerate neighbors under self-modiﬁed conditions ͑tolerance modiﬁcation͒. Second, plant-induced shifts in resource supply could enhance the degree to which species can suppress individuals ͑suppression modiﬁcation͒. We addressed these hypothesized mechanisms in the non-successional moist meadow alpine tundra, which is codominated by Acomastylis rossii, a slow-growing roseaceous forb with high nutrient retention that is associated with slow rates of nitrogen supply, and Deschampsia caespitosa, a graminoid with rapid growth potential that is associated with fast rates of nitrogen ͑N͒ supply. Neighbors inhibited Acomastylis transplants ͑the species with high N retention͒ less than Deschampsia transplants ͑the species with rapid potential growth͒ in both neighborhood types, and hence neighborhood type did not inﬂuence species tolerance to neighbors. Likewise, Acomastylis neighborhoods inhibited transplant growth more than Deschampsia neighborhoods regardless of transplant species identity. When N supply rates were enhanced through repeated N additions in the two neighborhood types or in the presence of each species’ litter, the inhibitory effects associated with Acomastylis were offset to a greater degree than those associated with Deschampsia, as predicted by the suppression modiﬁcation. These effects appeared to be density or size-dependent, with few effects observed at low density. Our results suggest that species effects on supply rates may inﬂuence competitive interactions, particularly if these effects are complemented by other sources of temporal or spatial variation such as pulses in resource availability.},

	abstract = {I investigated the separate and joint effects of herbivory (grazing) and competition on six grass species and on their distributions across the landscape. In a factorial field experiment, cattle were excluded from half the subplots, and neighboring plants were removed from half the subplots. Transplants of each of the species were planted in plots on hillsides and in flat areas, and the entire experiment was replicated in two pastures. The effects of grazing were negative and were proportional to the ungrazed height of each species. In the absence of grazing and competition, the flat plots were more favorable than the hillside plots. Grazing reversed the relative favorableness of flat and hillside plots, most likely because grazing was more intense in the flat plots due to cattle preference for flatter ground. The removal of neighboring plants always had a positive effect, indicating competition from neighboring plants. The relative impact of competition from pre-existing plants was generally greater in the flat plots than in the hillside plots. The relative impacts of grazing were generally greater in the absence of competing plants, and the relative impacts of competition were generally greater in the absence of grazing. The most likely explanation for this antagonistic interaction between the effects of herbivory and competition is an indirect positive effect of grazing that arose from a reduction in competition experienced by a target plant due to the defoliation of its neighbors. The results of this study, when combined with the known distributions of the six grass species in this region, indicate that herbivory, rather than competition or the physical environment, controls the distribution of at least five of the six species across the landscape. For example, Schizachyrium scoparium grew well in ungrazed flat subplots but very poorly in grazed flat subplots; grazing, not the physical environment or competition, accounts for the absence of S. scoparium from most flat sites in this region. Competition modulates the effects of herbivory and edaphic factors on landscape distributions but does not control the distribution of any of the six species.},

Here we attempt to place intra-speciﬁc competition in a climate change context, using as experimental system the drought-sensitive ﬁr Abies pinsapo. We conducted a decade-long (2004–2015) investigation at four permanent plots (two thinned plots and two controls), where all trees were identiﬁed, tagged and mapped. Experimental thinning was performed attempting to enhance stand structure diversity by (1) reducing tree competition, (2) increasing the equitability of size classes (i.e. diversity) and (3) randomizing tree spatial pattern. We focus on tree basal area increment and sap ﬂow density, as regards microclimate and competition, to quantify the extent to that thinning alleviates drought in the remaining trees. The results support that lower competition fosters short- to long-term tree-level physiological responses, speciﬁcally, improved growth and water uptake in the remaining trees. Density reduction provides a promising strategy for minimizing climate change eﬀects on drought-sensitive tree species by improving resources availability to the remaining trees. Nevertheless, our results also support a higher air temperature and soil water depletion according to density reduction, suggesting that lower competition might also increase soil and understory evapotranspiration. Adaptive management, as the experimental thinning reported here, may increase tree-level resources availability, but the long-term stand-level eﬀectiveness of this approach at sustaining forest ecosystem functioning remains uncertain.},

	abstract = {Growth variability, expressed by ring width sequences, was examined in an even-aged beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest in relation to stand structure, tree competition and climate. A competition-based growth model was developed to simulate stand dynamics and to calculate the yearly growth index series as a ratio between observed and predicted increments. Dendroclimatological analyses were used to evaluate the interactions between intraspecific competition and tree response to climate. For trees living at different competition levels, simple correlation coefficients were calculated between environmental variables (seasonal values of precipitation, temperature, water deficit and surplus) and the growth index series. Results show that beech response to temperature regime and water availability is significantly affected by competition level. When competition is strong, trees are highly sensitivity to water balance; whereas, at a low competition level, trees react positively to high temperatures. Considering that competition may affect tree sensitivity to climate and that thinnings can modify competition regimes it seems possible to influence the climate response of single trees and whole stands through silvicultural treatments and, consequently, to conduct forest management under a hypothesis of climate change. For this purpose, twenty thinning regimes were simulated with a single-tree growth model, varying the treatment intensity and frequency. Four representative regimes were analysed in detail, by examining the predicted yield and the distribution of trees in competition classes, and by evaluating stand sensitivity to climate change.},

	abstract = {Most studies of density-dependent demography in plants consider the density only of the single focal species being studied. However, density-dependent regulation in plants may frequently occur at the level of the entire community, rather than only within particular species. In addition, because density dependence may differ considerably (even in direction) among demographic parameters, generalizing about patterns of density dependence and extrapolating to lifetime fitness and to population dynamics require comparisons among life history stages, as well as among types of species and physical environments. We constructed seminatural communities of desert annuals composed of all the constituent species in the same relative proportions as found in the natural habitat. These experimental communities were planted at a range of densities that extended far above and below mean natural field density. We compared among physical environments (irrigation treatments), among communities from different physical environments, and among growth forms (dicot and graminoid) to search for generalizations about the magnitude and direction of density dependence. Strong evidence of community-level density dependence was detected at all three life history stages studied in these desert annuals: emergence, survival, and final size. However, both the direction and degree of consistency of this density dependence varied considerably among the stages. The strongest and most consistent competitive effects were experienced at the emergence stage, where the mechanism is most likely a form of interference competition rather than exploitation competition. At the survival stage, the magnitude of effects was highly variable among physical environments and source communities, but negative effects were relatively rare, with either positive or no significant effects of increasing density. Thus, exploitation competition was also unimportant at the survival stage. In contrast, for growth, exploitation competition appeared to be the primary mechanism of interaction influencing growth. This variation in mechanism, direction, and magnitude of interactions among life history stages suggests that current models of plant community structure that are based largely on exploitation competition as it influences growth (with mortality a simple function of growth) are inadequate for even this simple annual plant community. We also compared growth forms and found that graminoids were superior competitors to dicots at the emergence and survival stages; they also had higher emergence and survival, regardless of density. Consistent with this result, grasses are always the numerical dominants in the source communities. In contrast, the two growth forms did not differ in competitive ability for growth, and dicots were consistently larger individuals, independent of density, even though grasses were also usually the biomass dominants in the source communities. These results suggest the importance of nontrophic mechanisms of interaction in controlling community structure and again emphasize the importance of constructing and testing models that incorporate multiple mechanisms of interactions.},

Density-dependent survival was a stabilizing process when acting in combination with density-dependent fecundity and probability of flowering; removing density-dependent survival from the model produced two-point cycles. The addition of a seed bank was also stabilizing. Simulations of control strategies at different life-history stages indicated that full control would be difficult due to the strong over-compensating density dependence, with severe reductions in fecundity and late season survival necessary in order to reduce equilibrium seed density and biomass.},

For situations where zero variances are implausible a priori, we propose a maximum penalized likelihood approach to avoid such boundary estimates. This approach is equivalent to estimating variance parameters by their posterior mode, given a weakly informative prior distribution. By choosing the penalty from the log-gamma family with shape parameter greater than 1, we ensure that the estimated variance will be positive. We suggest a default log-gamma(2, λ) penalty with λ → 0, which ensures that the maximum penalized likelihood estimate is approximately one standard error from zero when the maximum likelihood estimate is zero, thus remaining consistent with the data while being nondegenerate. We also show that the maximum penalized likelihood estimator with this default penalty is a good approximation to the posterior median obtained under a noninformative prior. Our default method provides better estimates of model parameters and standard errors than the maximum likelihood or the restricted maximum likelihood estimators. The log-gamma family can also be used to convey substantive prior information. In either case—pure penalization or prior information—our recommended procedure gives nondegenerate estimates and in the limit coincides with maximum likelihood as the number of groups increases.},

We hypothesize that positive interactions are maintained not only because of the recruitment benefits for the facilitated plants but also because of fitness benefits for the nurse plant. We tested this hypothesis by comparing seed production, seed predation and seed viability of a dominant nurse plant species (Mimosa luisana) when growing alone and in patches surrounded by its facilitated species. We also tested whether fitness of the nurse species is dependent on the phylogenetic neighborhood formed by their facilitated species using an analysis that accounted for the abundance and pairwise phylogenetic similitude of all species in each patch. Nurses growing associated to their facilitated species produced more seeds (1.86 times) and these seeds were more viable (1.47 times) than those of nurses growing alone. Seed predation did not alter these fitness differences. Seed number and viability increased in phylogenetically diverse neighborhoods. We conclude that distantly related partners are more likely to cause reciprocal increases in fitness, and that such effects contribute to species coexistence.},

	abstract = {1 The stress-gradient hypothesis ({SGH}) predicts that the frequency of facilitative and competitive interactions will vary inversely across abiotic stress gradients, with facilitation being more common in conditions of high abiotic stress relative to more benign abiotic conditions. With notable exceptions, most tests of the {SGH} have studied the interaction between a single pair or a few pairs of species, and thus have evaluated shifts in the magnitude and direction of pair-wise interactions along stress gradients, rather than shifts in the general frequency of interactions. 2 The {SGH} has been supported by numerous studies in many ecosystems, has provided a crucial foundation for studying the interplay between facilitation and competition in plant communities, and has a high heuristic value. However, recent empirical research indicates that factors like the variation among species and the nature of the stress gradient studied add complexity not considered in the {SGH}, creating an opportunity to extend the {SGH}'s general conceptual framework. 3 We suggest that one approach for extending the {SGH} framework is to differentiate between the original idea of how ‘common’ interactions might be along stress gradients and the ubiquitous empirical approach of studying shifts in the strength of pair-wise interactions. Furthermore, by explicitly considering the life history of the interacting species (relative tolerance to stress vs. competitive ability) and the characteristics of the stress factor (resource vs. non-resource) we may be able to greatly refine specific predictions relevant to the {SGH}. 4 We propose that the general pattern predicted by the {SGH} would hold more frequently for some combinations of life histories and stress factor, particularly when the benefactor and beneficiary species are mostly competitive and stress-tolerant, respectively. However, we also predict that other combinations are likely to yield different results. For example, the effect of neighbours can be negative at both ends of the stress gradient when both interacting species have similar ‘competitive’ or ‘stress-tolerant’ life histories and the abiotic stress gradient is driven by a resource (e.g. water). 5 Synthesis. The extension of the {SGH} presented here provides specific and testable hypotheses to foster research and helps to reconcile potential discrepancies among previous studies. It represents an important step in incorporating the complexity and species-specificity of potential outcomes into models and theories addressing how plant–plant interactions change along stress gradients.},

	abstract = {Propagule pressure can determine the success or failure of invasive plant range expansion. Range expansion takes place at large spatial scales, often encompassing many types of land cover, yet the effect of landscape context on propagule pressure remains largely unknown. Many studies have reported a positive correlation between invasive plant abundance and human land use; increased propagule pressure in these landscapes may be responsible for this correlation. We tested the hypothesis that increased rates of seed dispersal by fig-eating birds, which are more common in urban habitats, result in an increase in invasive strangler fig abundance in landscapes dominated by human land use. We quantified abundance of an invasive species (Ficus microcarpa) and a native species (F. aurea) of strangler fig in plots spanning the entire range of human land use in South Florida, {USA}, from urban parking lots to native forest. We then compared models that predicted juvenile fig abundance based on distance to adult fig seed sources and fig-eating bird habitat quality with models that lacked one or both of these terms. The best model for juvenile invasive fig abundance included both distance to adult and fig-eating bird habitat terms, suggesting that landscape effects on invasive fig abundance are mediated by seed-dispersing birds. In contrast, the best model for juvenile native fig abundance included only presence/absence of adults, suggesting that distance from individual adult trees may have less effect on seed limitation for a native species compared to an invasive species undergoing range expansion. However, models for both species included significant effects of adult seed sources, implying that juvenile abundance is limited by seed arrival. This result was corroborated by a seed addition experiment that indicated that both native and invasive strangler figs were strongly seed limited. Understanding how landscape context affects the mechanisms of plant invasion may lead to better management techniques. Our results suggest that prioritizing removal of adult trees in sites with high fig-eating bird habitat may be the most effective method to control F. microcarpa abundance.},

Here we show evidence that complementarity is contingent on tree size across large-scale climatic gradients in Europe. We compiled growth data of the 14 most dominant tree species in 32,628 permanent plots covering boreal, temperate and Mediterranean forest biomes. Niche complementarity is expected to result in significant growth increments of trees surrounded by a larger proportion of functionally dissimilar neighbours. Functional dissimilarity at the tree level was assessed using four functional types: i.e. broad-leaved deciduous, broad-leaved evergreen, needle-leaved deciduous and needle-leaved evergreen. Using Linear Mixed Models we show that, complementarity effects depend on tree size along an energy availability gradient across Europe. Specifically: (i) complementarity effects at low and intermediate positions of the gradient (coldest-temperate areas) were stronger for small than for large trees; (ii) in contrast, at the upper end of the gradient (warmer regions), complementarity is more widespread in larger than smaller trees, which in turn showed negative growth responses to increased functional dissimilarity. Our findings suggest that the outcome of species mixing on stand productivity might critically depend on individual size distribution structure along gradients of environmental variation.},

	abstract = {Spatial community reassembly driven by changes in species abundances or habitat occupancy is a well-documented response to anthropogenic global change, but communities can also reassemble temporally if the environment drives differential shifts in the timing of life events across community members. Much like spatial community reassembly, temporal reassembly could be particularly important when critical species interactions are temporally concentrated (e.g., plant-pollinator dynamics during flowering). Previous studies have documented species-specific shifts in phenology driven by climate change, implying that temporal reassembly, a process we term “phenological reassembly,” is likely. However, few studies have documented changes in the temporal co-occurrence of community members driven by environmental change, likely because few datasets of entire communities exist. We addressed this gap by quantifying the relationship between flowering phenology and climate for 48 co-occurring subalpine wildflower species at Mount Rainier (Washington, {USA}) in a large network of plots distributed across Mt. Rainier's steep environmental gradients; large spatio-temporal variability in climate over the 6 yr of our study (including the earliest and latest snowmelt year on record) provided robust estimates of climate-phenology relationships for individual species. We used these relationships to examine changes to community co-flowering composition driven by ‘climate change analog’ conditions experienced at our sites in 2015. We found that both the timing and duration of flowering of focal species was strongly sensitive to multiple climatic factors (snowmelt, temperature, and soil moisture). Some consistent responses emerged, including earlier snowmelt and warmer growing seasons driving flowering phenology earlier for all focal species. However, variation among species in their phenological sensitivities to these climate drivers was large enough that phenological reassembly occurred in the climate change analog conditions of 2015. An unexpected driver of phenological reassembly was fine-scale variation in the direction and magnitude of climatic change, causing phenological reassembly to be most apparent early and late in the season and in topographic locations where snow duration was shortest (i.e., at low elevations and on ridges in the landscape). Because phenological reassembly may have implications for many types of ecological interactions, failing to monitor community-level repercussions of species-specific phenological shifts could underestimate climate change impacts.},

	abstract = {Positive interactions among plants can increase species richness by relaxing environmental filters and providing more heterogeneous environments. However, it is not known if facilitation could affect coexistence through other mechanisms. Most studies on plant coexistence focus on negative frequency-dependent mechanisms (decreasing the abundance of common species); here, we test if facilitation can enhance coexistence by giving species an advantage when rare. To test our hypothesis, we used a global data set from drylands and alpine environments and measured the intensity of facilitation (based on co-occurrences with nurse plants) for 48 species present in at least 4 different sites and with a range of abundances in the field. We compared these results with the degree of facilitation experienced by species which are globally rare or common (according to the {IUCN} Red List), and with a larger data base including over 1200 co-occurrences of target species with their nurses. Facilitation was stronger for rare species (i.e. those having lower local abundances or considered endangered by the {IUCN}) than for common species, and strongly decreased with the abundance of the facilitated species. These results hold after accounting for the distance of each species from its ecological optimum (i.e. the degree of functional stress it experiences). Synthesis. Our results highlight that nurse plants not only increase the number of species able to colonize a given site, but may also promote species coexistence by preventing the local extinction of rare species. Our findings illustrate the role that nurse plants play in conserving endangered species and link the relationship between facilitation and diversity with coexistence theory. As such, they provide further mechanistic understanding on how facilitation maintains plant diversity.},

The values of the input vector are redistributed to minimize both the number and the size of messages that are injected into the network during a {SpMV}, leading to a reduction in communication costs.
